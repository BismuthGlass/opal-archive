# Idea

I would like to have a tool to organize and categorize all my media, including images, videos, books and audio. Each file will be assigned metadata as described in `schema.md`. This format is primarily for JSON sidecars, but in this case we will be using it over a dedicated database.

As for bulk, we are talking about managing a couple tens of thousands of files.

## Techstack

This will be a rust application exposing an API. This API will mainly be accessed through an SPA frontend. Uploaded files will be managed by the application itself, and stored in internal storage.

Since the program deals with media, we can use tools such as ffmpeg and imagemagick and others to retrieve and handle data from files, such as their resolution and so on. In other words, it's fine to use external CLI tools, provided that these are documented as dependencies.

The SPA should be light:

- Rust
- SQLite
- SolidJS

Minimize third party libraries beyond this as much as possible, unless they are reliable and would save considerable development effort (it's ok to use a rust crate for handling SQLite, for example.)

There are future plans for a CLI tool, but that is not described yet. It should be kept in mind when designing the API.

## Key features

- Easy to mass edit file metadata
- Easy to export / download files, including bulk downloads
- Robust group system
- Accessible to most platforms, browser based
- Modern UI focused on performance
- Robust query system for finding files, text based
- Persistent search tabs

## Internal storage

Uploaded files should be brought into internal storage, with their hash for a filename (keep extension intact). The user is never expected to see or access this internal storage.

Thumbnails should also be stored for each file (in a separate dir).

## The schema

The metastasis v1.0 format describes a system using sidecar files. This should not be the case in our application. Instead the metadata should be stored in the SQLite database. Fields should be appropriately constrained to possible values, and no custom fields are allowed.

Collections should behave as their own entities that may also be categorized and searched in the same way as files. The hierarchical directory concept of categories does not apply, as the system isn't directory based. Groups can still belong to other groups, however.

There is no need to support injesting existing sidecar files on file upload for now. We will also support exporting sidecar files, but that's in the future.

## Authentication

The application doesn't need to support authentication for now.
